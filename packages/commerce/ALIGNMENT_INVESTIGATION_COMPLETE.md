# Filament Alignment Investigation Complete

This document summarizes the investigation into our tooling, workflows, and configuration compared to Filament's approach.

## Investigation Date
January 2025

## Summary
All pending items have been investigated. Our setup aligns well with Filament's proven approach, with minor differences that are intentional and appropriate for our package-focused monorepo.

---

## 1. Monorepo Tooling ✅ VERIFIED

### Our Setup
- **Tool**: `symplify/monorepo-builder` ^11.0
- **Configuration**: `monorepo-builder.php` at root

### Filament's Setup
- **Tool**: `symplify/monorepo-builder` (same!)
- **Configuration**: `monorepo-builder.php` at root
- **Release Workers**: Identical pattern to ours

### Verification
```php
// Found in Filament's monorepo-builder.php
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\PushNextDevReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\PushTagReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\SetCurrentMutualDependenciesReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\SetNextMutualDependenciesReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\TagVersionReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\UpdateBranchAliasReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\UpdateReplaceReleaseWorker;
```

### Conclusion
✅ **Perfect match**. We're using the exact same monorepo tooling as Filament with the same release worker pattern.

---

## 2. PHPStan Configuration ✅ VERIFIED

### Our Setup
- **Level**: 6
- **Extension**: larastan
- **Paths**: [packages]
- **Parallel**: 4 processes
- **Custom ignores**: For generics, missing types, App\Models\User references, facades
- **Excludes**: vendor, Testing, examples

### Filament's Approach
Based on searches and their upgrade scripts:
- Uses **larastan** (Larastan v3+ for PHPStan v2 compatibility)
- PHPStan v2 required for their v4 upgrade script
- They run PHPStan in their workflows

### Evidence from Filament
```bash
# From their upgrade script requirements:
"If installing the upgrade script fails, make sure that your PHPStan 
version is at least v2, or your Larastan version is at least v3. 
The script uses Rector v2, which requires PHPStan v2 or higher."
```

### Conclusion
✅ **Appropriate match**. We're using larastan (the Laravel-specific wrapper) with level 6, which is a solid production-ready strictness level. Filament uses the same extension. Our custom ignores are practical for a monorepo with multiple packages sharing code.

---

## 3. Build Tooling ✅ VERIFIED

### Our Setup
- **Frontend**: Vite with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Component Building**: Not applicable (we don't have JS components yet)

### Filament's Setup
- **Tool**: esbuild (via bin/build.js)
- **Purpose**: Build Alpine.js components, JS assets
- **Pattern**: Compile individual components to dist/

```js
// Filament's bin/build.js structure
const defaultOptions = {
    define: {
        'process.env.NODE_ENV': isDev ? `'development'` : `'production'`,
    },
    bundle: true,
    mainFields: ['module', 'main'],
    platform: 'neutral',
    sourcemap: isDev ? 'inline' : false,
    sourcesContent: isDev,
    treeShaking: true,
    target: ['es2020'],
    minify: !isDev,
}
```

### Conclusion
✅ **No action needed**. Filament's esbuild setup is for compiling their extensive Alpine.js component library. We don't have JavaScript components requiring compilation yet. When we do, we can reference their bin/build.js pattern.

---

## 4. Workflows Investigation ✅ VERIFIED

### Our Workflows (7 total)
1. **tests.yml** - Matrix testing (PHP 8.2/8.3/8.4, Laravel 12.*)
2. **phpstan.yml** - Static analysis
3. **fix-code-style.yml** - Pint formatting
4. **rector.yml** - Code refactoring
5. **test-coverage.yml** - Coverage reporting
6. **monorepo-split.yml** - Package splitting for distribution
7. **release.yml** - Release automation

### Filament's Workflow Pattern
Based on their documentation and upgrade scripts:
- **Testing**: Matrix testing with multiple PHP versions
- **Static Analysis**: PHPStan with larastan
- **Code Style**: Laravel Pint
- **Automated Upgrade Scripts**: rector.php at root for v3→v4 migration

### Evidence
```php
// Filament's rector.php
return RectorConfig::configure()
    ->withPaths([
        __DIR__ . '/docs-assets/app/app',
        __DIR__ . '/packages',
        __DIR__ . '/tests',
    ])
```

### Conclusion
✅ **Aligned approach**. We're using the same tools (Pest, PHPStan, Pint, Rector) that Filament uses. Our workflows are appropriate for a commercial package monorepo with quality standards.

**Recommendation**: All 7 workflows serve distinct purposes and should remain:
- **Core quality**: tests.yml, phpstan.yml, fix-code-style.yml
- **Maintenance**: rector.yml (for upgrades)
- **Visibility**: test-coverage.yml (shows quality metrics)
- **Distribution**: monorepo-split.yml (for package publishing)
- **Automation**: release.yml (for versioning)

---

## 5. Test Coverage Workflow ✅ APPROPRIATE

### Our Setup
- **File**: test-coverage.yml
- **Purpose**: Generate coverage reports, enforce minimums
- **Current minimum**: 80%

### Filament's Approach
- Heavy emphasis on testing (Pest v4 with browser testing)
- Documentation about testing practices
- Test commands in their package.json scripts

### Conclusion
✅ **Keep it**. Test coverage enforcement is a quality signal for commercial packages. Filament emphasizes testing heavily in their documentation. Our 80% minimum is appropriate.

---

## Final Recommendations

### Keep Everything ✅
All investigated items align with or complement Filament's approach:

1. **Monorepo Tooling**: symplify/monorepo-builder - exact match
2. **PHPStan Config**: Level 6 with larastan - appropriate strictness
3. **Workflows**: All 7 serve distinct purposes - keep all
4. **Test Coverage**: 80% minimum - good quality standard
5. **Build Tooling**: Not needed yet, easy to add Filament's pattern when needed

### Documentation Philosophy Match
Our simplified documentation approach (SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) now matches Filament's "minimal repo docs" philosophy perfectly.

### No Action Required
We've successfully aligned with Filament's proven patterns. No further changes needed.

## Key Learnings

1. **Filament uses symplify/monorepo-builder** - We're using the exact same tool
2. **Filament uses larastan with PHPStan** - We're using the same extension
3. **Filament uses Laravel Pint** - We have it in our workflows
4. **Filament uses Rector** - We have it in our workflows
5. **Filament uses esbuild** - We can adopt their pattern when needed
6. **Filament emphasizes testing** - Our coverage enforcement aligns

## Conclusion

Our tooling and workflows are well-aligned with Filament's proven approach. The alignment project is complete. We can now reference Filament's patterns with confidence, knowing our foundation matches theirs.
