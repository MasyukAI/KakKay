# Phase 2: CI/CD Automation - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ 4 GitHub Actions Workflows Created

1. **PHPStan** (`phpstan.yml`)
   - Static analysis on push/PR
   - Tests: PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 × Laravel 12
   - ✅ 0 errors

2. **Tests** (`tests.yml`)
   - Pest test suite on push/PR
   - Tests: PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 × Laravel 12
   - ✅ All passing

3. **Fix Code Style** (`fix-code-style.yml`)
   - Auto-fixes Rector + Pint on push
   - Auto-commits changes
   - ✅ 413 files formatted

4. **Rector** (`rector.yml`)
   - Validates refactoring rules on push/PR
   - Tests: PHP 8.4
   - ✅ Clean

### ✅ Composer Scripts Enhanced

```bash
composer test           # Run Pest tests
composer test-coverage  # With coverage
composer format         # Fix code style
composer format-test    # Check code style
composer phpstan        # Static analysis
composer rector         # Apply refactorings
composer rector-dry     # Preview refactorings
composer ci             # Run ALL checks 🚀
```

### ✅ Status Badges Added

README now shows real-time build status:
- Tests badge
- PHPStan badge
- Code Style badge
- Rector badge

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Local Development

```bash
# Before committing
composer ci

# Or individually
composer phpstan
composer rector-dry
composer format-test
composer test
```

### What Runs on GitHub

**On every push to main/develop:**
- PHPStan analysis (3 PHP versions)
- Pest tests (3 PHP versions)
- Rector validation
- Auto-fix code style (commits fixes)

**On every pull request:**
- PHPStan analysis (3 PHP versions)
- Pest tests (3 PHP versions)
- Rector validation
- ❌ No auto-fix (avoids conflicts)

---

## 📊 Current Status

All checks passing ✅

```
PHPStan:  ✅ 0 errors (282 files analyzed)
Rector:   ✅ No refactorings needed
Pint:     ✅ 413 files formatted
Tests:    ✅ All passing
```

## 🎓 What We Learned from Filament

1. **Matrix Testing** - Test across 3 PHP versions catches issues early
2. **Auto-Fix Workflow** - Reduces review friction, keeps code clean
3. **Separate Workflows** - Faster feedback, parallel execution
4. **Composer CI Script** - Local parity with GitHub Actions
