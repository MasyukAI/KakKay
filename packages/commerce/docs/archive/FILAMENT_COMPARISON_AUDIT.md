# Filament Comparison Audit

**Date:** January 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Identify everything we implemented beyond what Filament actually uses  
**Goal:** Match Filament 1:1 for easier reference and maintenance

---

## Executive Summary

After comparing our monorepo with Filament's actual setup, here's what we added beyond their approach:

| Category | What We Added | What Filament Uses | Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Workflows | 7 workflows | Unknown (need to verify) | ✅ Keep if useful, ❌ Remove if Filament doesn't have |
| Documentation | docs/, SECURITY.md, multiple guides | Contributing guide, security policy | 🟡 Simplify to match Filament |
| PHPStan Config | Custom phpstan.neon | Need to check Filament's setup | 🟡 Match Filament's config |
| Monorepo Tool | symplify/monorepo-builder | Unknown | 🟡 Verify Filament's tool |
| Test Coverage Enforcement | 80% minimum via workflow | Unknown | 🟡 Check Filament's requirement |

---

## Phase-by-Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Emergency Cleanup ✅ ALIGNED

**What We Did:**
- PHPStan level 6
- Fixed 170 errors → 0 errors
- Removed duplicate code

**What Filament Uses:**
- PHPStan level 6 (confirmed via README badge)
- Clean codebase

**Status:** ✅ **ALIGNED** - This is correct

---

### Phase 2: CI/CD Automation 🟡 NEEDS VERIFICATION

**What We Implemented:**

#### Our 7 Workflows:
1. `tests.yml` - Run Pest tests on PHP 8.2/8.3/8.4
2. `phpstan.yml` - Static analysis
3. `fix-code-style.yml` - Auto-fix with Pint
4. `rector.yml` - PHP upgrades
5. `test-coverage.yml` - Enforce 80% minimum
6. `monorepo-split.yml` - Split to read-only repos
7. `release.yml` - Semantic versioning

**What Filament Uses:**
- From README: "Tests passing" badge suggests they have tests workflow
- Need to verify: https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/tree/main/.github/workflows

**Action Required:**
1. Check Filament's actual `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Compare workflow structures
3. Remove any workflows Filament doesn't use
4. Simplify workflows to match Filament's approach

---

### Phase 3: Documentation 🔴 **OVER-DOCUMENTED**

**What We Created:**

#### Documentation Files:
1. `CONTRIBUTING.md` (comprehensive contributing guide)
2. `CHANGELOG.md` (semantic versioning log)
3. `SECURITY.md` (comprehensive security guide - **378 lines**)
4. `docs/index.md` (documentation index)
5. `docs/development/testing.md` (testing guide)
6. `PHASE_1-5_COMPLETE.md` (internal phase docs)
7. Package READMEs (8 packages)

**What Filament Uses:**
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Yes, but simpler
- `SECURITY.md` - Yes, but **only 7 lines** (points to website)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Yes
- `LICENSE.md` - Yes  
- Package READMEs - Yes
- Internal docs - Via website, not in repo

**Status:** 🔴 **BLOATED** - We over-documented

**Action Required:**
1. **Simplify SECURITY.md** - Should be 7 lines like Filament, pointing to documentation
2. **Remove** `docs/` directory - Filament uses website for this
3. **Simplify CONTRIBUTING.md** - Match Filament's structure
4. **Remove** all `PHASE_*.md` files - These are internal, not needed long-term
5. **Keep** Package READMEs - Filament has these

---

### Phase 4: Monorepo Automation 🟡 NEEDS VERIFICATION

**What We Implemented:**
- `symplify/monorepo-builder` for version syncing
- Monorepo split workflow
- Release workflow with semantic versioning

**What Filament Uses:**
- Monorepo confirmed (packages/ directory)
- Tool unknown - need to check their approach
- They do have read-only package splits (e.g., filamentphp/forms)

**Action Required:**
1. Check if Filament uses MonorepoBuilder or different tool
2. Verify their split/release strategy
3. Match their approach if different

---

### Phase 5: Polish & Finalization 🟡 PARTIALLY ALIGNED

**What We Did:**
1. ✅ Added PHPStan extensions (phpstan/phpstan, extension-installer)
2. ✅ Synced package versions
3. ✅ Standardized package READMEs
4. 🟡 Test coverage audit (76% overall, 80% target via workflow)
5. 🔴 Created comprehensive SECURITY.md (378 lines)
6. 🔴 Created docs/ directory
7. ✅ Removed Infection, composer-unused

**What Filament Uses:**
- PHPStan extensions: ✅ Yes
- Package READMEs: ✅ Yes
- Test coverage enforcement: Unknown (need to check workflows)
- SECURITY.md: ✅ Yes, but **only 7 lines**
- Internal docs: ❌ No, uses website

**Status:** 🟡 **MIXED** - Some good, some bloat

---

## Critical Findings

### 🔴 We Over-Documented (Phase 3 Issue)

**Our SECURITY.md:** 378 lines with:
- Input validation best practices
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Authentication & authorization
- API security
- Webhook security
- File upload security
- Session security
- Security headers
- Checklist

**Filament's SECURITY.md:** 7 lines:
```markdown
# Security Policy

Please review the [Version Support Policy](https://filamentphp.com/docs/introduction/version-support-policy) on our website.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Filament, please [report it through GitHub](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/security/advisories). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
```

**Lesson:** Keep repo minimal, put detailed docs on website.

---

### 🔴 We Created Internal Docs Directory

**We have:**
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/development/testing.md`

**Filament has:**
- Separate `docs/` repo for website documentation
- No internal `docs/` in main repo

**Lesson:** Docs belong on website, not in monorepo.

---

### 🟡 Unknown Workflow Differences

We created 7 workflows but can't verify if Filament uses all these:
- tests ✅ (confirmed via badge)
- phpstan ❓
- fix-code-style ❓
- rector ❓
- test-coverage ❓
- monorepo-split ❓
- release ❓

**Action:** Check Filament's `.github/workflows/` directory

---

### 🟡 Unknown Monorepo Tooling

We use `symplify/monorepo-builder`, but:
- Filament definitely has monorepo
- Unknown what tool they use (if any)
- May use manual scripts or different approach

**Action:** Check Filament's `composer.json` and build scripts

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Removals 🔴

1. **Simplify SECURITY.md**
   ```bash
   # Replace 378-line guide with 7-line version pointing to docs
   ```

2. **Remove docs/ directory**
   ```bash
   rm -rf /Users/Saiffil/Herd/kakkay/packages/commerce/docs/
   ```

3. **Remove Phase documents** (keep for reference first)
   ```bash
   # Keep for now, remove after project stabilizes:
   # PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md
   # PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md
   # PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md
   # PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md
   # PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md
   # PHASE_5_PROGRESS.md
   # FILAMENT_ANALYSIS.md
   # MONOREPO_MIGRATION.md
   ```

### Verifications Needed 🟡

1. **Check Filament's Workflows**
   - Visit: https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/tree/main/.github/workflows
   - Compare with our 7 workflows
   - Remove any we have that they don't

2. **Check Filament's Monorepo Tool**
   - Look at their `composer.json` scripts
   - Check if they use MonorepoBuilder or alternatives
   - Match their approach

3. **Check Filament's PHPStan Config**
   - Find their `phpstan.neon` or equivalent
   - Compare with ours
   - Match their level, paths, and ignores

4. **Check Filament's Test Coverage**
   - See if they enforce minimum coverage
   - Check if they have test-coverage workflow
   - Match their requirement (or remove ours)

### Keep These ✅

1. **PHPStan Level 6** - Confirmed Filament uses this
2. **PHPStan Extensions** - Confirmed matches Filament
3. **Package READMEs** - Filament has these
4. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Filament has this (may need simplification)
5. **Package Version Syncing** - Good practice regardless

## Why This Matters

Your reasoning is spot-on:

> "The reason i would like to follow them similarly is because its easy for me to look at them back for reference of good practises and real life example."

**Benefits of 1:1 Matching:**
1. **Easy Reference** - Can look at Filament for examples
2. **Proven Practices** - They've refined this over years
3. **Less Maintenance** - Only maintain what's necessary
4. **Community Alignment** - Others familiar with Filament understand your setup
5. **No Bloat** - Keep repo focused on code, not documentation

---

## Next Steps

1. **User Approval** - Confirm which removals/changes to proceed with
2. **Check Filament's Repo** - Verify workflows, tools, and configs
3. **Execute Removals** - Delete bloated documentation
4. **Simplify Structure** - Match Filament's minimal approach
5. **Document Final State** - Create FILAMENT_ALIGNED.md showing 1:1 match

---

## Questions for User

1. Should we check Filament's GitHub workflows now and adjust ours?
2. Should we remove `docs/` directory immediately?
3. Should we simplify SECURITY.md to 7 lines like Filament?
4. Should we remove all PHASE_*.md files (or keep for your reference)?
5. Should we verify Filament's monorepo tooling and potentially switch?

**Status:** Awaiting user decision on which actions to take.
