# AIArmada Cart Core Package

This package contains the core implementation that powers **AIArmada Cart**. It is published as `aiarmada/cart` on Packagist and intended for Laravel 12 applications seeking a feature-rich shopping cart engine.

## Highlights

- 📦 **Pluggable storage** – session, cache, and database drivers that implement a shared interface.
- 🛒 **Composable cart architecture** – traits manage items, totals, metadata, and conditions.
- 🔁 **Multi-instance by default** – support any number of cart buckets per user or session.
- 🧮 **Accurate calculations** – Akaunting\Money integration for precise totals and rounding.
- 📈 **Observability hooks** – metrics, conflict tracking, and per-operation performance measurements.
