# Filament Alignment Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to align our Commerce monorepo with Filament's structure and best practices.

## Completed Actions

### 1. ✅ Simplified SECURITY.md
**Before:** 378 lines of comprehensive security guide  
**After:** 7 lines pointing to security contact

```md
# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:
1. DO NOT open a public issue
2. Email: security@aiarmada.com

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
```

**Reason:** Filament keeps repo minimal, detailed docs go on website (when we have one).

### 2. ✅ Organized Documentation
**Actions:**
- Created `docs/archive/` for internal documentation
- Moved PHASE_*.md files to archive
- Moved FILAMENT_ANALYSIS.md to archive
- Moved MONOREPO_MIGRATION.md to archive
- Moved FILAMENT_COMPARISON_AUDIT.md to archive
- Simplified `docs/index.md` (removed quick start examples)
- Simplified `docs/development/testing.md` (removed verbose examples)

**Result:** Clean docs structure focused on navigation, not tutorials.

### 3. ✅ Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
**Content:** Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v1.4  
**Contact:** security@aiarmada.com

**Reason:** Filament has this, we needed it.

## Documentation Philosophy

Following Filament's approach:
- **Keep repo minimal** - Just navigation and structure
- **Package READMEs** - Detailed docs live in each package
- **Archive internal docs** - Keep them for reference but out of sight
- **External documentation** - When we have a website, move detailed guides there

## What We Keep

### Root Files
- ✅ README.md - Project overview
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md - Version history
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md - How to contribute
- ✅ SECURITY.md - Security contact (7 lines)
- ✅ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md - Community standards
- ✅ LICENSE.md - MIT License

### Documentation
- ✅ docs/index.md - Package navigation
- ✅ docs/development/testing.md - Quick testing reference
- ✅ docs/archive/ - Internal documentation (PHASE_*.md, analysis files)

### Package READMEs
All 8 packages have comprehensive READMEs:
- packages/cart/README.md
- packages/chip/README.md
- packages/docs/README.md
- packages/filament-cart/README.md
- packages/filament-chip/README.md
- packages/jnt/README.md
- packages/stock/README.md
- packages/vouchers/README.md

### 4. ✅ Simplified CONTRIBUTING.md
**Before:** 558 lines of verbose contribution guide  
**After:** ~70 lines of concise, actionable sections

**Sections:**
- Reporting Bugs
- Proposing New Features
- Pull Requests (7-step process)
- Code Quality (3 essential commands)
- Developing with Local Copy (JSON example)
- Security Vulnerabilities
- Code of Conduct

**Reason:** Filament's docs are concise and actionable. Give contributors what they need, not everything we know.

## Pending Verifications ✅ ALL COMPLETE

All pending items have been investigated and verified. See `ALIGNMENT_INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE.md` for full details.

1. ✅ **Workflows** - All 7 workflows serve distinct purposes and align with Filament's tooling approach
2. ✅ **Monorepo Tooling** - We use `symplify/monorepo-builder` ^11.0 - **exact match** with Filament
3. ✅ **PHPStan Config** - Level 6 with larastan - matches Filament's use of larastan extension

### Investigation Highlights

- **Monorepo**: Filament uses the exact same tool (symplify/monorepo-builder) with identical release worker pattern
- **Static Analysis**: Filament uses larastan with PHPStan v2+, we're aligned
- **Code Style**: Both use Laravel Pint
- **Refactoring**: Both use Rector
- **Testing**: Both use Pest with matrix testing across PHP versions
- **Build Tools**: Filament uses esbuild for Alpine.js components; we can adopt their pattern when needed

## Key Reasoning

### Why We Follow Filament

1. **Proven Pattern** - Filament is production-tested by thousands
2. **Easy Reference** - When stuck, we can look at their code
3. **Community Standards** - Matches Laravel ecosystem expectations
4. **Maintenance** - Less to document = less to maintain
5. **Verified Tooling** - Same monorepo tools, same quality standards

### Quality Over Quantity

- **Before:** Verbose documentation trying to cover everything
- **After:** Minimal, focused documentation
- **Result:** Easier to maintain, harder to get out of date

### Alignment Status: COMPLETE ✅

We've successfully aligned our repository structure, documentation, and tooling with Filament's proven patterns. We can now reference their codebase with confidence, knowing our foundation matches theirs.

## Next Steps

1. Verify Filament's workflows and match ours
2. Verify Filament's monorepo tooling
3. Compare PHPStan configurations
4. Consider removing test-coverage workflow if Filament doesn't enforce minimums
