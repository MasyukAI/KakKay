# Workflows Comparison: Our Setup vs Filament

This document provides a detailed comparison of our 7 GitHub Actions workflows with Filament's approach.

## Our 7 Workflows

### 1. tests.yml - Automated Testing
**Purpose:** Run test suite across multiple PHP and Laravel versions  
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, pull requests  
**Matrix:**
```yaml
php: [8.4, 8.3, 8.2]
laravel: [12.*]
testbench: [10.*]
```

**What it does:**
- Checks out code
- Sets up PHP with extensions
- Installs dependencies
- Runs Pest test suite

**Filament equivalent:**
- ✅ Filament runs automated tests
- ✅ Uses matrix testing across PHP versions
- ✅ Uses Pest as testing framework
- ✅ Tests on push and pull requests

**Why we need it:** Core quality gate - ensures all tests pass before merging.

---

### 2. phpstan.yml - Static Analysis
**Purpose:** Run PHPStan static analysis to catch type errors  
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, pull requests  
**Configuration:**
```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G
```

**What it does:**
- Runs PHPStan level 6 with larastan
- Checks type safety
- Validates code structure
- Uses 4 parallel processes

**Filament equivalent:**
- ✅ Filament uses PHPStan with larastan
- ✅ Requires PHPStan v2+ for v4 (mentioned in upgrade docs)
- ✅ Runs static analysis in CI/CD

**Evidence from Filament:**
```
"If installing the upgrade script fails, make sure that your PHPStan 
version is at least v2, or your Larastan version is at least v3."
```

**Why we need it:** Catches bugs before runtime - essential for type-safe code.

---

### 3. fix-code-style.yml - Code Formatting
**Purpose:** Automatically fix code style using Laravel Pint  
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, pull requests  
**Configuration:**
```bash
vendor/bin/pint --dirty
```

**What it does:**
- Runs Laravel Pint on changed files
- Auto-commits formatting fixes
- Ensures consistent code style

**Filament equivalent:**
- ✅ Filament uses Laravel Pint
- ✅ Pint is the official Laravel code formatter
- ✅ Enforces PSR-12 compliance

**Evidence from Filament:**
```php
// From their package scripts and workflows
"fix-style": "vendor/bin/pint"
```

**Why we need it:** Maintains code consistency across contributors automatically.

---

### 4. rector.yml - Code Refactoring
**Purpose:** Run Rector for automated code upgrades and refactoring  
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, pull requests  
**Configuration:**
```bash
vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run
```

**What it does:**
- Checks for upgrade opportunities
- Validates code patterns
- Ensures modern PHP practices

**Filament equivalent:**
- ✅ Filament uses Rector extensively
- ✅ Has rector.php at root
- ✅ Used for v3→v4 automated upgrades

**Evidence from Filament:**
```php
// rector.php at root
return RectorConfig::configure()
    ->withPaths([
        __DIR__ . '/packages',
        __DIR__ . '/tests',
    ])
```

**Their upgrade script:**
```bash
vendor/bin/rector process {$directory} --config vendor/filament/upgrade/src/rector.php
```

**Why we need it:** Keeps codebase modern and enables automated upgrades.

---

### 5. test-coverage.yml - Coverage Reporting
**Purpose:** Generate test coverage reports and enforce minimums  
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, pull requests  
**Configuration:**
```bash
vendor/bin/pest --coverage --min=80
```

**What it does:**
- Runs tests with coverage collection
- Enforces 80% minimum coverage
- Uploads coverage reports
- Provides quality metrics

**Filament equivalent:**
- ⚠️ Not directly visible in public workflows
- ✅ BUT: Filament heavily emphasizes testing in docs
- ✅ Has extensive test coverage (evident from test files)
- ✅ Uses Pest v4 with browser testing

**Evidence from Filament:**
```php
// They have comprehensive test coverage
tests/
  Feature/
  Unit/
  Browser/  // Pest v4 browser tests
```

**Why we need it:** 
- Quality signal for commercial packages
- Prevents untested code from merging
- Aligns with Filament's testing emphasis
- Useful for package consumers to see quality metrics

---

### 6. monorepo-split.yml - Package Distribution
**Purpose:** Split monorepo packages for individual distribution  
**Triggers:** Push to tags (releases)  
**Configuration:**
```yaml
uses: symplify/github-action-monorepo-split
```

**What it does:**
- Splits packages into separate repositories
- Enables individual package distribution
- Maintains separate package versions
- Publishes to Packagist

**Filament equivalent:**
- ✅ Filament is a monorepo with split packages
- ✅ Uses symplify/monorepo-builder (confirmed!)
- ✅ Distributes packages individually via Packagist

**Evidence from Filament:**
```php
// monorepo-builder.php at root - EXACT MATCH
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\PushNextDevReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\PushTagReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\SetCurrentMutualDependenciesReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\SetNextMutualDependenciesReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\TagVersionReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\UpdateBranchAliasReleaseWorker;
use Symplify\MonorepoBuilder\Release\ReleaseWorker\UpdateReplaceReleaseWorker;
```

**Their package structure:**
```
packages/
  actions/
  filament/
  forms/
  infolists/
  notifications/
  panels/
  schemas/
  support/
  tables/
  widgets/
```

**Why we need it:** 
- Essential for distributing individual packages
- Allows consumers to install only what they need
- Matches Filament's distribution model exactly

---

### 7. release.yml - Release Automation
**Purpose:** Automate version bumping and changelog generation  
**Triggers:** Manual workflow dispatch or tag push  
**Configuration:**
```yaml
uses: symplify/monorepo-builder
```

**What it does:**
- Bumps package versions
- Updates CHANGELOG.md
- Creates GitHub releases
- Coordinates monorepo releases

**Filament equivalent:**
- ✅ Filament has release automation
- ✅ Uses the same MonorepoBuilder release workers
- ✅ Coordinates package versions

**Evidence from Filament:**
```php
// They use identical release workers:
$services->set(UpdateReplaceReleaseWorker::class);
$services->set(SetCurrentMutualDependenciesReleaseWorker::class);
$services->set(TagVersionReleaseWorker::class);
$services->set(PushTagReleaseWorker::class);
$services->set(SetNextMutualDependenciesReleaseWorker::class);
$services->set(UpdateBranchAliasReleaseWorker::class);
$services->set(PushNextDevReleaseWorker::class);
```

**Why we need it:** 
- Ensures consistent versioning across packages
- Reduces manual release errors
- Maintains proper semantic versioning
