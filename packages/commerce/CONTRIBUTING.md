## Developing with a Local Copy

To test Commerce in a real Laravel app:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/masyukai/kakkay)
2. Create a Laravel app locally
3. Clone your fork into the app's root: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kakkay.git`
4. Add to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "aiarmada/cart": "*",
        "aiarmada/chip": "*"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "kakkay/packages/commerce/packages/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Run `composer update`

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

1. **Use Pest** - All tests use Pest, not PHPUnit
2. **Test coverage** - Aim for >80% coverage
3. **Test types**:
   - Unit tests: Test individual classes/methods
   - Feature tests: Test integration between components
   - Browser tests: Test UI functionality (Filament packages)

### Test Structure

```php
<?php

use AIArmada\Cart\Models\Cart;

it('calculates total with conditions', function () {
    $cart = Cart::create();
    
    $cart->addItem([
        'id' => 1,
        'name' => 'Test Product',
        'price' => 100,
        'quantity' => 2,
    ]);
    
    $cart->addCondition([
        'name' => 'VAT',
        'type' => 'tax',
        'value' => '10%',
    ]);
    
    expect($cart->total())->toBe(220.00);
});
```

### Factories

Use factories for test data:

```php
$cart = Cart::factory()->create();
$item = CartItem::factory()->create(['cart_id' => $cart->id]);
```

---

## Documentation Standards

### Package README

Each package should have:
- Installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Configuration options
- Testing instructions
- Links to detailed docs

### Code Documentation

- Add PHPDoc blocks for public methods
- Include `@param` and `@return` tags
- Add usage examples in docblocks
- Document complex logic with inline comments

### Changelog

Update `CHANGELOG.md` for each package when making changes.

## Monorepo Workflow

### Understanding the Monorepo

This repository uses a monorepo structure where all packages are developed together:

```
packages/
├── cart/              # Core cart engine
├── chip/              # CHIP payment gateway
├── docs/              # Document generation
├── jnt/               # J&T Express API
├── stock/             # Stock management
├── vouchers/          # Voucher system
├── filament-cart/     # Filament cart admin
└── filament-chip/     # Filament CHIP admin
```

On release, packages are automatically split to separate repositories:
- `aiarmada/cart`
- `aiarmada/chip`
- `aiarmada/docs`
- etc.

### Monorepo Commands

```bash
# Merge all package composer.json files
composer monorepo:merge

# Validate package dependencies
composer monorepo:validate

# Bump interdependencies to a version
composer monorepo:bump-interdependency "^2.0"

# Create a release (updates all packages)
composer monorepo:release 2.1.0
```

### Package Development

When developing a new feature:

1. **Work in the monorepo** - Make changes in `packages/your-package/`
2. **Test across packages** - Ensure changes work with dependent packages
3. **Update dependencies** - If you change a package's API, update dependents
4. **Run validation** - `composer monorepo:validate` before committing

### Versioning

All packages use **synchronized versioning**:
- Version numbers are the same across all packages
- A release creates tags for all packages
- Semantic versioning is enforced

### Release Process

Releases are **automated via GitHub Actions**:

#### Creating a Release

1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
2. Go to **Actions** → **Create Release** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Enter:
   - **Version**: Semver format (e.g., `2.1.0`)
   - **Release type**: major, minor, or patch
5. Click **Run workflow**

The workflow will:
1. ✅ Validate the version format
2. 📝 Update `CHANGELOG.md` (move Unreleased to version)
3. 🔄 Update all package versions and dependencies
4. 🏷️ Create and push git tag
5. 📦 Trigger monorepo split (packages → separate repos)
6. 📋 Create GitHub release with notes
7. ⬆️ Bump to next dev version

#### Manual Release (Advanced)

For manual releases:

```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG
vim CHANGELOG.md  # Move [Unreleased] to [2.1.0]

# 2. Run monorepo-builder release
composer monorepo:release 2.1.0

# 3. Create and push tag
git add .
git commit -m "chore: release v2.1.0"
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release v2.1.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v2.1.0
```

#### Package Split

When a tag is pushed, the **Monorepo Split** workflow automatically:

1. Detects the tag (e.g., `v2.1.0`)
2. Splits each package to its own repository:
   - `packages/cart` → `github.com/aiarmada/cart`
   - `packages/chip` → `github.com/aiarmada/chip`
   - etc.
3. Tags each split repository with the same version

This allows:
- Users install individual packages: `composer require aiarmada/cart`
- Each package has its own repository and issues
- Monorepo development continues seamlessly

### Package Dependencies

When packages depend on each other:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "aiarmada/cart": "^2.0",
    "aiarmada/stock": "^2.0"
  }
}
```

Use `composer monorepo:bump-interdependency` to update all cross-package dependencies at once.

### Testing Before Release

Before creating a release:

```bash
# 1. Run full CI suite
composer ci

# 2. Validate monorepo structure
composer monorepo:validate

# 3. Merge and check for conflicts
composer monorepo:merge

# 4. Review changes
git status
git diff
```

### After Release

After a successful release:

1. ✅ Check split repositories have the tag
2. ✅ Verify Packagist updated the versions
3. ✅ Test installing the released versions:
   ```bash
   composer require aiarmada/cart:^2.1
   ```
4. ✅ Check GitHub releases have correct notes
5. 📢 Announce the release (Twitter, Discord, etc.)
