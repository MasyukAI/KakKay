- âœ… Modern PHP 8.4 features everywhere
- âœ… Type safety at all levels

### 3. **Move Fast**
- âœ… No deprecation warnings needed
- âœ… No gradual migration required
- âœ… Can implement all phases quickly
- âœ… Test and iterate rapidly

### 4. **Clean Slate**

## ðŸš€ Updated Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: âœ… COMPLETE
Already done, no concerns about breaking changes.

### Phase 2: New Endpoints
- Implement `printWaybill()` with perfect design
- No need to worry about existing implementations

### Phase 2.5: Type Safety (CRITICAL)
- **Implement aggressively:**
  - Update ALL Data classes with clean names
  - Add context-aware TypeTransformer methods
  - Add full validation everywhere
  - Change any property/method signatures needed
  
- **No concerns about:**
  - Breaking existing code (no existing code!)
  - Deprecation path (not needed!)
  - Migration guide (new package!)

### Phase 3: Webhook System
- Design webhook system perfectly from scratch
- No legacy webhook handling to support

### Phase 4: Laravel Integration
- Perfect Laravel integration from day one
- No compromise for non-Laravel users (they don't exist yet!)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision: Start Phase 2.5 Immediately

**Recommendation:** Jump straight to Phase 2.5 (Type Safety) since:

1. **Most Critical** - Your 5 requirements align with Phase 2.5
2. **Clean Foundation** - Get types right before adding more features
3. **No Rush** - Can design perfectly without compatibility concerns
4. **Proper Order** - printWaybill (Phase 2) will benefit from Phase 2.5 work

**Order:**
1. âœ… Phase 1 - COMPLETE
2. ðŸ”´ **Phase 2.5 - START NOW** (Type Safety & API Compliance)
3. Phase 2 - New Endpoints (will have correct types from day 1!)
4. Phase 3 - Webhooks (will have correct types from day 1!)
5. Phase 4 - Laravel Integration
6. Phase 5 - Polish & Release
