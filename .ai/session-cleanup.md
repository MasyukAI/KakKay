# Session Storage Cleanup

## Removed Redundant Session Data

### What Was Removed:

**From `app/Livewire/Checkout.php`:**
```php
// REMOVED - These session values were never used:
session([
    'chip_purchase_id' => $result['purchase_id'],
    'checkout_data' => $formData,
]);
```

**From `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`:**
```php
// REMOVED - Session fallback (CHIP always sends purchase_id in URL):
$purchaseId = $request->get('purchase_id') ?? session('chip_purchase_id');

// CHANGED TO:
$purchaseId = $request->get('purchase_id');
```

### Why These Were Redundant:

1. **CHIP Always Includes `purchase_id` in Redirect URLs**
   - Success redirect: `https://yoursite.com/checkout/success?purchase_id=pur_abc123`
   - Failure redirect: `https://yoursite.com/checkout/failure?purchase_id=pur_abc123`
   - No need for session fallback

2. **All Customer Data Stored in Cart Metadata**
   - Form data stored as `payment_intent.customer_data` in cart metadata
   - Retrieved from cart when webhook arrives
   - No need to duplicate in session

3. **Order Creation Happens Via Webhook, Not Redirect**
   - Redirect pages only display order information
   - They don't create or modify anything
   - Session data not needed for display

### What Was Never Used:

- **`checkout_data`**: Stored but never retrieved anywhere in the codebase
- **`chip_purchase_id`**: Only used as fallback, but CHIP always provides it in URL

### Modern Flow (No Session Needed):

```
1. Customer clicks "Bayar Sekarang"
   ↓
2. Payment intent stored in cart.metadata
   ↓
3. Customer redirected to CHIP with checkout URL
   ↓
4. Customer completes payment
   ↓
5. CHIP redirects back with purchase_id in URL
   └→ Success: /checkout/success?purchase_id=pur_abc123
   └→ Failure: /checkout/failure?purchase_id=pur_abc123
   ↓
6. Webhook arrives (order created here)
   ↓
7. Success/failure pages query database using purchase_id from URL
```

### Benefits:

✅ **Cleaner Code** - Removed unused session storage  
✅ **Simpler Flow** - Rely on URL parameters as intended  
✅ **Less State** - No session data to manage or clean up  
✅ **More Explicit** - Shows CHIP provides purchase_id in redirects  
✅ **Tests Pass** - All checkout tests passing  

### Testing:

All checkout tests pass after removal:
```
✓ checkout creates payment intent and redirects to payment page
✓ checkout fails gracefully when cart is empty
✓ checkout validates required form fields
✓ checkout handles payment gateway errors gracefully

Tests: 4 passed (12 assertions)
```

## Key Insight

The session storage was **legacy defensive programming** from before the webhook-based architecture was fully implemented. With the current architecture:

- **Cart metadata** is the single source of truth during checkout → webhook flow
- **CHIP redirect URLs** always include purchase_id
- **Database queries** retrieve order information using purchase_id from URL
- **Session storage** serves no purpose and can be removed

This cleanup aligns the code with the actual flow and removes confusion about where data is stored.
