# Package Development Guidelines

These guidelines ensure packages are reliable and modern, with no backward compatibility or deprecated functions, targeting PHP 8.4.

## Core Principles
- Develop exclusively for PHP 8.4. No support for older versions.
- Remove deprecated functions immediately without maintaining compatibility.
- Use `context7` documentation for PHP 8.4 and package development best practices.
