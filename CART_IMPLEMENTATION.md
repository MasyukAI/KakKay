# Shopping Cart Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a fully functional shopping cart system for the Kak Kay e-commerce application using Laravel Livewire and the `joelwmale/laravel-cart` package.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Cart Page (`/cart`)
- **Route**: `/cart` (named route: `cart`)
- **Component**: Volt component at `resources/views/livewire/cart.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Display all cart items with product images, names, and prices
  - Quantity adjustment (increment/decrement buttons)
  - Remove items from cart with confirmation
  - Real-time cart total calculation (subtotal, savings, shipping, tax)
  - Voucher/coupon code application
  - Empty cart state with "Continue Shopping" link
  - Responsive design with dark mode support

### 2. Cart Counter Component
- **Component**: `app/Livewire/CartCounter.php`
- **View**: `resources/views/livewire/cart-counter.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time cart item count display
  - Updates automatically when items are added/removed
  - Badge notification style (red circle with count)
  - Listens to `product-added-to-cart` event

### 3. Add to Cart Component
- **Component**: Volt component at `resources/views/livewire/add-to-cart.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Quantity selector with +/- buttons
  - Add to cart button with shopping cart icon
  - Success message when item is added
  - Dispatches `product-added-to-cart` event

### 4. Navigation Integration
- Added cart icon to both desktop and mobile navigation
- Cart counter badge displays on cart icon
- Links to cart page when clicked

## Technical Implementation

### Cart Package Configuration
- Uses `joelwmale/laravel-cart` package
- Session-based storage
- Prices stored in cents for precision
- Configuration in `config/cart.php`

### Pricing System
- All prices stored in database as integers (cents)
- Display prices converted to decimal format (e.g., 5000 cents = RM 50.00)
- Consistent pricing throughout cart operations

### Cart Management Trait
- **Trait**: `app/Traits/ManagesCart.php`
- Provides common cart operations:
  - `setCartSession()` - Sets unique session key per user
  - `getCartCount()` - Returns total quantity of items
  - `getCartSubtotal()` - Returns subtotal in cents
  - `getCartTotal()` - Returns total including conditions

### Livewire Events
- `product-added-to-cart` - Triggered when items are added or removed
- Updates cart counter automatically across components

## Routes Added
```php
Volt::route('/cart', 'cart')->name('cart');
Route::view('/checkout', 'checkout')->name('checkout');
```

## Database Integration
- Works with existing `Product` model
- Supports product images via Spatie Media Library
- Price field already configured as integer (cents)

## Styling & UI
- Uses Flowbite/Tailwind CSS components
- Consistent with existing application design
- Responsive grid layout for cart items
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Dark mode support

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Navigate to Home Page
- Visit `/` to see products with "Add to Cart" buttons
- Each product shows name, price, and quantity selector

### 2. Add Products to Cart
- Use quantity selector to choose amount
- Click "Add to Cart" button
- See success message and cart counter update

### 3. View Cart
- Click cart icon in navigation
- See all added items with ability to modify quantities
- View calculated totals and proceed to checkout

### 4. Cart Operations
- Increase/decrease quantities
- Remove items completely
- Apply voucher codes
- Proceed to checkout flow

## Future Enhancements
1. Persistent cart storage for logged-in users
2. Product variant support (size, color, etc.)
3. Wish list functionality
4. Cart abandonment recovery
5. Bulk actions (clear cart, save for later)
6. Mobile-optimized cart drawer

## Dependencies
