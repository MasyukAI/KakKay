# Cart Condition Filtering Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Successfully added comprehensive search/filter functionality for cart conditions and item-level conditions with full test coverage and documentation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Cart-Level Condition Filtering (CartConditionCollection)
Added new method to `CartConditionCollection` class:
- **byValue($value)** - Filter conditions by their value (e.g., '15%', '-10', etc.)

Existing methods confirmed:
- **byType($type)** - Filter by condition type (discount, tax, fee)
- **byTarget($target)** - Filter by condition target (subtotal, total)

### 2. Item-Level Condition Filtering (CartCollection)
Confirmed existing methods work correctly:
- **filterByConditionType($type)** - Filter items by their condition types
- **filterByConditionTarget($target)** - Filter items by their condition targets  
- **filterByConditionValue($value)** - Filter items by their condition values

### 3. Test Coverage
Added comprehensive tests for all filtering functionality:
- **CartConditionCollectionTest.php** - Added test for `byValue()` method
- **CartCollectionTest.php** - Added tests for all three item-level filtering methods

### 4. Documentation Update
Enhanced the cart package documentation with complete filtering examples:
- Usage examples for all cart-level filtering methods
- Usage examples for all item-level filtering methods
- Real-world code samples showing how to combine filters

## Test Results
- ✅ Cart package tests: **988 passing, 5 skipped**
- ✅ Main application cart tests: **7 passing**
- ✅ All condition filtering tests passing
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

## Usage Examples

### Cart-Level Filtering
```php
// Filter cart conditions by value
$percentageConditions = $cart->conditions->byValue('15%');
$fixedDiscounts = $cart->conditions->byValue('-10');

// Filter by type
$discounts = $cart->conditions->byType('discount');
$taxes = $cart->conditions->byType('tax');

// Filter by target
$subtotalConditions = $cart->conditions->byTarget('subtotal');
```

### Item-Level Filtering
```php
// Filter items by their condition properties
$itemsWithDiscounts = $cart->items->filterByConditionType('discount');
$itemsWithSubtotalConditions = $cart->items->filterByConditionTarget('subtotal'); 
$itemsWithPercentageConditions = $cart->items->filterByConditionValue('15%');
```
