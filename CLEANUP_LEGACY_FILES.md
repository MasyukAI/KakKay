# Code Cleanup - Legacy Files Removal

## Summary
Cleaned up outdated legacy backup files that were no longer in use.

## Files Removed

### Service Files
- ❌ `app/Services/CheckoutService.legacy.php` - Old version before payment intent refactor

### Test Files
- ❌ `tests/Feature/CheckoutServiceImprovedTest.legacy.php` - Outdated test
- ❌ `tests/Feature/CheckoutServiceIntegrationTest.legacy.php` - Outdated test
- ❌ `tests/Feature/CheckoutServiceRefactoredTest.legacy.php` - Outdated test

## Verification

### ✅ No Code References
```bash
# Verified no active code references legacy files
grep -r "CheckoutService.legacy" app/ routes/ --include="*.php"
# Result: No matches
```

### ✅ Tests Still Pass
```bash
vendor/bin/pest --filter="CheckoutOrderCreation|HandlePaymentSuccess"
# Result: 5 passed (20 assertions)
```

### ✅ Pest Doesn't Detect Legacy Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/pest --list-tests | grep -i legacy
# Result: No matches (exit code 1)
```

## Why These Were Safe to Remove

1. **CheckoutService.legacy.php**
   - Old implementation that created orders during checkout
   - New implementation uses payment intent metadata approach
   - No references in active codebase
   - All code uses `CheckoutService::class` which resolves to the current version

2. **Legacy Test Files**
   - Tests for the old CheckoutService implementation
   - Pest doesn't detect `.legacy.php` files as tests
   - Active tests cover current functionality
   - Would fail if run due to changed implementation

## Current Active Files

### Service
- ✅ `app/Services/CheckoutService.php` - Current implementation with payment intents

### Tests
- ✅ `tests/Feature/CheckoutOrderCreationTest.php` - Active checkout tests
- ✅ `tests/Feature/HandlePaymentSuccessTest.php` - Active payment webhook tests
- ✅ `tests/Feature/WebhookIdempotencyTest.php` - New idempotency tests
- ✅ `tests/Feature/CheckoutTest.php` - General checkout tests
- ✅ `tests/Feature/CheckoutDuplicateOrderPreventionTest.php` - Duplicate prevention tests

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Confusion** - No more wondering which file is active
2. **Cleaner Codebase** - Less clutter in the repository
3. **Faster Searching** - IDE and grep searches return only relevant results
4. **Clear Intent** - Single source of truth for CheckoutService
5. **Easier Maintenance** - No accidental edits to wrong files

## Best Practices Going Forward

Instead of creating `.legacy` files, use Git for version control:

```bash
# View history of a file
git log -p app/Services/CheckoutService.php

# Compare current version with previous commit
git diff HEAD~1 app/Services/CheckoutService.php

# Create a branch for experimental changes
git checkout -b experiment/new-checkout-flow
```

This keeps the working directory clean while preserving history.
